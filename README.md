# :shark: Bruce

Bruce is meant to be a versatile ESP32 firmware that supports a ton of offensive features focusing on facilitating Red Team operations.
It also supports m5stack products and works great with Cardputer, Sticks, M5Cores, T-Decks and T-Embeds.

## :building_construction: How to install

### The easiest way to install Bruce is using our official Web Flasher!
### Check out: https://bruce.computer/flasher

Alternatively, you can download the latest binary from releases or actions and flash locally using esptool.py
```sh
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash 0x00000 Bruce-<device>.bin
```

**For m5stack devices**

If you already use M5Launcher to manage your m5stack device, you can install it with OTA

Or you can burn it directly from the [m5burner tool](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/download), just search for 'Bruce' (My official builds will be uploaded by "owner" and have photos.) on the device category you want to and click on burn

## :sparkles: Why and how does it look?

Bruce stems from a keen observation within the community focused on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offered a glimpse into the world of offensive security, there was a palpable sense that something more could be achieved without being that overpriced, particularly with the robust and modular hardware ecosystem provided by ESP32 Devices, Lilygo and M5Stack products.
