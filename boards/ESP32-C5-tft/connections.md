# Pinouts diagram to use Bruce

## USING CUSTOM BOARD, with SPI
| Device  | SCK   | MISO  | MOSI  | CS    | GDO0/CE   |
| ---     | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:     |
| Display | 6     | 2     | 7     | 23    |           |
| SD Card | 6     | 2     | 7     | 10    | ---       |
| CC1101  | 6     | 2     | 7     | 9*    | 8*        |
| NRF24   | 6     | 2     | 7     | 9*    | 8*        |
(*) CC1101, NRF24, W5500 use the same pinouts, need to add a switch on CS and CE/GDO0 to choose which to use.

If using Buttons, use thesee pinouts
| Buttons | GPIO  |
| ---     | :---: |
| Prev    | 0     |
| Sel     | 28    |
| Next    | 1     |

If using ILI9341 with XPT2046 fo touchscreen, in this case you have 2 GPIO available (0 and 28) to use on CC1101/NRF24
| Device  | SCK   | MISO  | MOSI  | CS    | IRQ   |
| ---     | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Display | 6     | 2     | 7     | 23    | ---   |
| XPT2046 | 6     | 2     | 7     | 1     | ---   |


| Device  | RX    | TX    | GPIO  |
| ---     | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| GPS     | 4     | 5     | ---   |
| IR RX   |  ---  | ---   | 26    |
| IR TX   |  ---  | ---   | 3     |
| LED     |  ---  | ---   | 27    |

ESP32-C5 doesn't support USB-OTG, for BadUSB you need to use a CH9329 module

FM Radio, PN532 on I2C, other I2C devices, CH9329, shared with GPS Serial interface.
I2C SDA: 4
I2C SCL: 5

Serial interface to other devices (Flipper)
Serial Tx: 11
Serial Rx: 12
