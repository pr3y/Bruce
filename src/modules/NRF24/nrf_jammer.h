         thank you for providing this simplified code for us!

Information:
    - This Jammer is supposed to be used for Educational purpouse only.
    - The signal is strong enaugh to mess with 2.4Ghz spectrum, so probaby 2.4Gz Wifi networks will be
affected causing a DOS attack
    - If the target is near the bluetooth source (smartphone right beside the bluetooth speaker), the
communication between them will be weakly affected (we don't do magic)

FLAFS:
    NRF24_CE_PIN=-1   ; Set this pin accordingly
    NRF24_SS_PIN=-1   ; Set this pin accordingly
    NRF24_MOSI_PIN=-1 ; Set this pin accordingly
    NRF24_SCK_PIN=-1  ; Set this pin accordingly
    NRF24_MISO_PIN=-1 ; Set this pin accordingly
